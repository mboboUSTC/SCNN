%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   Accurate segmentation of biomembrane objects is a crucial step to obtain morphological statistics in biomedical analysis.
   \mdf{In many scenarios, prior shape knowledge about the target object is available, which is valuable for resolving the coarse boundary and touching problem.}
   In this paper, we introduce a novel Deep Shape-Aware Network (DSAN) by incorporating prior shape knowledge about plausible components into segmentation tasks.
   Our DSAN is a multi-task framework that simultaneously predicts an objectness score and several shape parameters as auxiliary at each pixel.
   The shape parameters formulate the shape of each object, which can not only separate segmented objects into individual ones, but also optimize their boundaries in terms of prior shape knowledge.
   Furthermore, a novel split pooling operation is developed to optimize both objectness scores and shape parameters to produce better segmentation masks.
   The proposed framework is efficient and can be trained end-to-end.
   The experimental results on two challenging biomedical problems, including synaptic vesicles and histopathological glands segmentation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
   We expect our method to empower more work by utilizing prior shape knowledges into neural networks.
