%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   Accurate segmentation of biomembrane objects is a crucial step to obtain morphological statistics in biomedical analysis.
   In many scenarios, prior shape knowledge about the target objects is available, which is valuable for resolving the coarse boundary and touching problem.
   In this paper, we introduce a novel Deep Shape-Aware Network (DSAN) by incorporating prior shape knowledge about plausible components into the network.
   Our DSAN is a multi-task framework that simultaneously predicts an objectness score and several shape parameters as auxiliary at each pixel.
   The shape parameters formulate the shape of each object, which can not only separate segmented objects into individual ones, but also optimize their boundaries in terms of prior shape knowledge.
   Furthermore, a novel joint pooling operation is developed to optimize both objectness scores and shape parameters to produce better segmentation masks.
   The whole process is efficient and trained end-to-end.
   Experiments on two challenging biomedical problems, including synaptic vesicles and histopathological glands segmentation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
   And we expect our method to empower more work to utilize prior shape knowledge into neural networks to benefit their researches.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, a novel and general method is proposed for incorporating the prior shape knowledge into neural network to segment the plausible objects in biomedical images.
Based on the popular multi-task FCN in segmentation, we replace the auxiliary contour probability with the shape of objects, formulated by a set of meaningful parameters.
In order to improve the accuracy of predicted shape parameters, a novel joint max pooling layer is proposed to replace the predictions in boundary regions with those in center of an object.
Finally with our local fusion strategy, the degree of shape constraint can be flexibly adjusted in terms of different tasks.
We experiment our method on two biomedical tasks for segmenting synaptical vesicles from electron microscope images and the glandular structures from colorectal cancer tissues.
%To further prove the generality of our model to diverse shape constraint, we extend our method to the scene text detection task by segmenting the scene text region with regular shape.
All the experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method on the object segmentation problem with prior shape knowledge.


%The experiments have shown great superiority of our DSAN in segmentation tasks with available prior shape knowledge.
However, our method still has some limitations and can be improved in several directions. 
First, only parameterized shape constraints are supported in our network, such as ellipse, rectangle or starriness.
%
Extending our method to more complicated shapes is a future direction.
%
Second, our method only supports one type of shape constraints into the network each time so far.
%
%If the images contain several kinds of object with different prior shape knowledge, several DSANs are needed.
In the future, we will improve our approach to support more than one type of shapes in one network for a wider range of applications.
